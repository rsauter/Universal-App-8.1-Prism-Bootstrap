# Universal-App-8.1-Prism-Bootstrap
Bootstrap Solution for Visual Studio 2015. 
It's easy to create simple Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Store 8.1 Apps with Prism.

If you are creating a Windows Phone 8.1 App with Prism (including Unity & Folks) feel free and pull this Repo.

Hint: Flyout Menu does not yet work on Windows Store App 8.1. I'm working on this Issue. Sorry.
